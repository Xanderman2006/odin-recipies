    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is our <em>world-famous authentic recipe</em>.  Inspired by our family's italian
    traditions, passed down at least 4 generations, this pizza is the best you'll find in Italy
    or anywhere else!</p>

    <p>This world-famous recipe uses only fresh ingredients.  We grow many of the ingredients ourselves
        in a farm just outside the city.  For what we cannot grow ourselves, we work with local farmers 
        to get only the finest and <strong>most fresh</strong> ingredients!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste/li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>175 grams homemade pizza dough</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, <strong>crushed</strong></li>
            <li>3 ounces burrata cheese</li>
            <li>4 thin slices prosciutto, torn in half lengthwise</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
            <li>Heat pizza oven to 800 F.  See recipe variations below for home oven</li>
            <li>Put the tomato paste into a small bowl.  Add 1 tablespoon of water and salt.
            Stir to combine. Add a tiny bit more water to achieve a spreadable consistency.
            </li>
            <li>Dust the pizza peel with plenty of flour, and flour your hands. Gently 
                stretch your pizza dough into a circle approximately 12 inches in diameter. 
                Set it on the well-floured peel.</li>
            <li>Distribute the burrata evenly on the pizza. Move expeditiously. The longer 
                the sauced dough sits on the peel, the more likely it will be to stick when 
                you try to slide it into the oven.</li>

        </ol>
